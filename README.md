# Classfication-algorithm
This project was done with Ainize (Common computers) to show case how machine learning can be used to create software that allows classifying different sentences to their respective category.

# How does this work? 
The program allows the users to input a title, headline, or sentence and allows the program to predict what category it belongs to. This category includes Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sports, and Tech. 

For example, one can write “AMD announces $8 billion stock buyback program ” and the computer will predict the topic as ‘business’. This goes for the rest of the 4 topics as well. 

Well, how does this really work? The computer is first fed with different examples of the sentences and titles for each topic. For example, I would write [Topic_Name, Example_setence] to help the machine understand what each sentence is supposed to represent.

So what that means is I would have a large dataset, just like an excel sheet, filled with the name of the topic and the example sentence for that topic (I had a total of 2200 of these example data).  From that, the computer is able to learn and predict what a sentence represents (Just like how we study and give an answer). So, if I give a sentence to the computer, it will compare it with its current knowledge and give me a prediction based on that past learning. 

To put this whole process of it working into big words, this is Machine Learning which means  “A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building”

It is used really widely throughout the world and this is just one of the applications out of billions out there! 

It was a fun project to work on and I really enjoyed every aspect of this.
